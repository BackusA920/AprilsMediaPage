        <h2>Thought Flow</h2>
        <p>
          No words, no instructions, just pure atmosphere. This video is a sonic
          blanket woven from soul-crunching lo-fi beats, designed to dissolve
          distractions and guide you gently into your creative flow. It’s the
          kind of chill that makes your mind quiet and your ideas loud. Perfect
          for studying, coding, painting, or just vibing with the cosmos, one
          beat at a time.
